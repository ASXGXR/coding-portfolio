        I was tasked with creating a rum brand from scratch. This endeavor was an exciting journey through branding,
        product design, and digital presence. It provided me with valuable insights into 3D design, website creation,
        and photo
        editing.

      <h3>Product Design in Blender</h3>
      <p>
        The heart of this project was the creation of the rum bottle, meticulously modeled in Blender. Attention was
        paid to minor details, from the barrel shape that echoes the brand's adventurous spirit to the intricate cap
        design
        with thumb grip. The 3D modeling process ensured a realistic and compelling presentation
        of the product. I further utilised this design as a base to create other flavours and prototypes.

      <h3>Concept and Visual Identity</h3>
      <p>
        Guided by the research findings, the concept of Skull & Bones was born, symbolizing adventure and mystery. The
        logo adheres to Gestalt principles,
        ensuring unity and
        recognizability. Serifs in the typography mirror the crossbones, subtly emphasizing the brand theme, while
        kerning ensures versatility and readability.

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Creating the Skull & Bones Rum brand was an exciting journey of 3D modelling, branding and discovery. I gained a
        greater knowledge of 3D rendering, texturing and lighting through courses and intuition. I applied design
        principles to the packaging and logo, while keeping it fresh and unique. Skull&Bones provided me with
        valuable
        insights into what it takes to design a spirits brand from the ground up, and I will continue to grow and build
        on
        this project in the future.
