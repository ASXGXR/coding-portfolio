        I was tasked with creating a rum brand from scratch. This endeavor was an exciting journey through branding,
        product design, and digital presence. It provided me with valuable insights into 3D design, branding, and photo
        editing.

      <h3>Concept and Visual Identity</h3>
      <p>
        Guided by the research findings, the concept of Skull & Bones was born, symbolizing adventure, mystery, and
        the spirit of exploration. I crafted the logo using Adobe Illustrator. Many variations were produced to ensure a
        clear and precise pirate rum essence. See below to visualise how I applied the logo to the final piece.

      <h3>Product Design in Blender</h3>
      <p>
        The heart of this project was the creation of the rum bottle, meticulously modeled in Blender. Attention was
        paid to every detail, from the shape that echoes the brand's adventurous spirit to the intricate cap design
        with thumb grip. The 3D modeling process ensured a realistic and compelling presentation
        of the product.

        the rum brand.

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        The Skull & Bones Rum project was a comprehensive exercise in brand creation, from conceptualization to
        final
        product and digital presence. Each step of the journey was an opportunity to blend creativity with
        functionality, resulting in a brand that stands out in the crowded spirits market.
