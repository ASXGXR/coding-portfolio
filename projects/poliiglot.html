        Poliiglot is an AI-driven language learning app designed to offer a personalized and interactive learning
        experience. The project began with a vision to create an intuitive and engaging platform for users eager to
        explore new languages. My role encompassed UI/UX design, branding, and conceptualizing AI features, all crafted
        meticulously in Figma for iOS.

      <h3>User Interface and Experience</h3>
      <p>
        The design process started with extensive user research to understand the needs and preferences of language
        learners. With these insights, I crafted a clean, intuitive interface in Figma, focusing on simplicity and ease
        of navigation. The color scheme and typography were chosen to enhance readability and user engagement.
